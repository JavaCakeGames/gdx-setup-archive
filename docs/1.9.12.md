## libGDX changes

- [BREAKING CHANGE] iOS: Changed how Retina/hdpi handled on iOS. See #3709.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] API Change: InputProcessor scrolled method now receives scroll amount for X and Y. Changed type to float to support devices which report fractional scroll amounts. Updated InputEvent in scene2d accordingly: added scrollAmountX, scrollAmountY attributes and corresponding setters and getters. See #6154.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] API Change: Vector2 angleRad(Vector2) now correctly returns counter-clockwise angles. See #5428
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Android: getDeltaTime() now returns the raw delta time instead of a smoothed one. See #6228.
- Fixed vertices returned by Decal.getVertices() not being updated
- Fixes Issue #5048. The function Intersector.overlapConvexPolygons now should return the right minimum translation vector values.
- Update to MobiVM 2.3.11
- API Change: Removed Pool constructor with preFill parameter in favor of using Pool#fill() method. See #6117
- API Addition: Slider can now be configured to only trigger on certain mouse button clicks (Slider#setButton(int)).
- Fixed GlyphLayout not laying out correctly with color markup.
- Fixed TileDrawable not applying its scale correctly.
- API Addition: Added epsilon methods to maps with float values.
- API Addition: Added an insertRange method to array collections.
- Fixed GestureDetector maxFlingDelay.
- API Change: Changed default GestureDetector maxFlingDelay to Integer.MAX_VALUE (didn't work before, this matches that).
- Gdx.files.external on Android now uses app external storage - see wiki article File handling for more information
- Improved text, cursor and selection rendering in TextArea.
- API Addition: Added setProgrammaticChangeEvents, updateVisualValue, round methods to ProgressBar/Slider.
- iOS: Keyboard events working on RoboVM on iOS 13.5 and up, uses same API as on other platforms
- API Addition: Added AndroidLiveWallpaper.notifyColorsChanged() to communicate visually significant colors back to the wallpaper engine.
- API Change: AssetManager invokes the loaded callback when an asset is unloaded from the load queue if the asset is already loaded.
- GWT: changed audio backend to WebAudio API. Now working on mobiles, pitch implemented. Configuration change: preferFlash removed. When updating existing projects, you can remove the soundmanager js files from your webapp folder and the references to it from index.html
- GWT: added possibility to lazy load assets via AssetManager instead of preload them before game start. See GWT specifics wiki article for more information.
- GWT: New configuration setting usePhysicalPixels to use native resolution on mobile / Retina / HDPI screens. When using this option, make sure to update your code in index.html and HTMLLauncher from setup template.
- GWT: GwtApplicationConfiguration and GWT backend now support an application to be resizable or fixed size. You can remove your own resizing code from your HTMLLaunchers.
- GWT: Assets in distribute build are renamed with md5 hash suffix to bypass browser cache on changes
- GWT: Fixed GwtFileHandle that was only returning text assets when listing a directory, now returns all children
- API Addition: Pixmap.downloadFromUrl() downloads an image from http(s) URLs and passes it back as a Pixmap on all platforms
