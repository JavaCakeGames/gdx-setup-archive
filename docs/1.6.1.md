## libGDX changes

- Added optional hostname argument to Net.newServerSocket method to allow specific ip bindings for server applications made with gdx.
- Changed the way iOS native libs are handled. Removed updateRoboVMXML and copyNatives task from ios/build.gradle. Instead natives are now packaged in jars, within the META-INF/robovm/ios folder. Additionally, a robovm.xml file is stored there that gets merged with the project's robovm.xml file by RoboVM.
