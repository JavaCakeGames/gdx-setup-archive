## libGDX changes

- Fix NPE swallowing "video driver unsupported" error on LWJGL 2 backend.
- Allow window icons to be set in Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration or Lwjgl3WindowConfiguration.
- Allow window icon and title to be changed in Lwjgl3Window
- API Addition: ApplicationLogger interface, allowing easier access to custom logging
- DefaultRenderableSorter accounts for center of Renderable mesh, see https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4319
- Bullet: added FilterableVehicleRaycaster, see https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4361
- Bullet: updated to 2.85, see: [http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/?p=456](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/index.php/2016/10/07/bullet-2-84-released-pybullet-and-virtual-reality-support-for-htc-vive-and-oculus-rift/)
- Updated iOS native build scripts to iOS 10.1 and TVOS 10.0
- API Addition: BitmapFont#blankLineScale.
- Fixed rounding of Drawables in ProgressBar. Allow rounding to be disabled with setRound().
- Updated LWJGL3 backend to LWJGL 3.1.0, see https://blog.lwjgl.org/lwjgl-3-1-0-released/
- LWJGL3 backend now supports non-continuous rendering, see https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3772
- API Change: Lwjgl3WindowListener.refreshRequested() is called when the windowing system (GLFW) reports contents of a window are dirty and need to be redrawn.
- API Change: Lwjgl3WindowListener.maximized() is called when a window enters or exits a maximized state.
- API Change: Lwjgl3WindowListener.deiconified() removed, combined with .iconified().
- API Change: Lwjgl3Window.deiconify() renamed to .restore() since it can also be used to de-maximize a window.
- Lwjgl3Window now has a maximize() method, and windows can be started maximized using the window or app configuration's setMaximized() method.
- NinePatch can now be drawn rotated or scaled.
- NinepatchDrawable is now a TransformDrawable.
- API Change: Group add* methods no longer remove and re-add the actor if it is already in the group, instead they do nothing.
- API Change: g2d.Animation is now generic so it can support Drawables, PolygonRegions, NinePatches, etc. To fix existing code, specify the TextureRegion type in animation declarations (and instantiations in Java 6), i.e. Animation<TextureRegion> myAnimation = new Animation<TextureRegion>(...);
- TiledDrawable throws unsupported operation if trying to draw rotated/scaled. #4005
- API Change: DragAndDrop now puts default position of drag actor at pointer location. The original default offset from the pointer was (14, -20).
- Added ShaderProgramLoader for AssetManager.
- BoundingBox#isValid now returns also true when min==max, see: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4460
