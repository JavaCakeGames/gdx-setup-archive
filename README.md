# gdx-setup archives

## Who?

gdx-setup is created by the libGDX people. See [libgdx/libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).

## What?

An archive of all the gdx-setup versions I can lay my hands on.

## When?

Version 0.9.3 (2012) to the last nightly (2024).

## Where?

Here? If on mobile, click "View code" from this repository's homepage to view the files.

You may also wish to browse via [this repository's website](https://javacakegames.github.io/gdx-setup-archive/).

gdx-setup source code was sourced from `extensions/gdx-setup/` within the [libGDX source code](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).

## Why?

I was unable to find most old versions up for download, so I compiled the ones I didn't find myself and mirrored the rest here.

While I'd advise against using them, they may be of some benefit to those working with older projects or out of morbid curiosity for what previous versions were like.

## How?

I compiled them by running `ant` in the source directory with my `JAVA_HOME` set to OpenJDK 8. 1.11.0 and up were build with `./gradlew extensions:gdx-setup:build`.

Sources are included here for ease of access, but the JARs are likely more of interest.
